# Snakes-Game using SystemVerilog
This game uses SystemVerilog, DE1_SoC, 16x16 LED array expansion board, and external keyboard, to implement the game snakes. The user uses the 
keyboard to move the snake around the 16x16 LED expansion board to eat apples and gain points. The game ends when the snake hits the boundaries
or if it collides with itself.
